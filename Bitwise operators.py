# This code demonstrates the use of the right shift operator in Python.
# The right shift operator (>>) shifts the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of positions.

# The left shift operator (<<) shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions.
# The left shift operator is often used to multiply a number by a power of 2.
c=a|b
print(c)
# The bitwise OR operator (|) compares each bit of two numbers and returns a new number with bits set to 1 if either of the corresponding bits is 1.
# The bitwise OR operator is often used to combine two numbers.
d=a&b
print(d)
# The bitwise AND operator (&) compares each bit of two numbers and returns a new number with bits set to 1 if both of the corresponding bits are 1.
# The bitwise AND operator is often used to find common bits between two numbers.
e=a^b
print(e)
# The bitwise XOR operator (^) compares each bit of two numbers and returns a new number with bits set to 1 if the corresponding bits are different.
# The bitwise XOR operator is often used to find bits that are different between two numbers.
f=~a
print(f)
# The bitwise NOT operator (~) inverts the bits of a number, changing 1s to 0s and 0s to 1s. =-(num+1)
# The bitwise NOT operator is often used to find the complement of a number.
